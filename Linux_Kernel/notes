* Various Unix-like systems on the market:
	- All commerciail variants were derived from either SVR4 or 4.4BSD.
	- All tend to agree on some common standards like IEEE's Portable Operating Systems based on Unix(POSIX) and X/Open's Common Applications Environment(CAE).

* Linux vs. Unix kernels:
	- Monolithic kernel: 
		Linux + most commercial Unix variants.
		However Mac OS X and GNU Hurd are microkernel.
	- Compiled and statically linked traditional Unix kernels:
		Most modern kernels can DYNAMICALLY load and unload some portions of the kernel code(typically, device drivers). 
		Linux's support for modules: 
			allows to automatically load and unload modules on demand. 
	- Kernel threading:
		Linux uses kernel threads in a very limited way to execute a few functions periodically. 
	- Multithreaded application support:
		- Most modern operating systems have some kind of support for multithreaded applications.
		- Multithreaded user applications: 
			"user programs that are designed in terms of many relatively independent execution flows that share a large portion of the application data structures. Be composed of many lightweight processes(LWP)"
			- LWP:
				"processes that can operate on a common address space, common physical memory pages, common opened files..." 
				- Other commercial Unix variants of LWP are based on kernel threads.
				- Linux regards LWP as the basic execution context and handles them via the nonstandard clone() system call. 
	- Preemptive kernel:
		"When compiled with the Preemptible Kernel option, Linux 2.6 can arbitrarily interleave execution flows while they are in privileged mode."
		Linux has Preemptible Kernel option starting from 2.6
	- Multiprocessor support:
		Linux 2.6 supports symmetric mutiprocessing(SMP) for different memory models.

* Multiuser Systems:
	"A computer that is able to concurrently + independently execute several applications belonging to two or more users."
	- Applications can be active AT THE SAME TIME and contend for the various resources such as CPU, memory, hard disks...
	- Each application can perform its task with no concern for what others are doing.
	- Users and Groups: 
		- All users are identified by a unique number called User ID or UID.
		- Each user is a member of one or more user groups, which are identified by a unique number called a user group ID. Each file is associated with exactly one group. 
		- root/superuser:
			"Any Unix-like" OS has a special user called root or superuser. The root user can access every file on the system and can manipulate every running user program.
