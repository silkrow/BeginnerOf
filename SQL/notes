* Data Model
A data model is a notation for describing data or information. The description generally consists of three parts:
1. Structure of the data:
	data structures used to implement data in the computer(physical data model)
2. Operations on the data:
	limited set of queries and modifications
3. Constraints on the data:
	way to describe limitations on what the data can be. These constraints often come from the real-world application requirements.

* relation = table
  schema = the definition(like the category names on the first row)
  tuple/records = rows in the table
  
  since schema is fixed and records can be modified/added, we refer to schema as the intension of the table, and records as the extension of the table, also called extent.
  cardinality = number of rows in the table

 * foreign key
 	An idea used when connecting two tables. 
	There can be a key in both table1 and table2, saying table1.key is a foreign key that references table2.key. If the DBMS enforces this constraint, we have referential integrity.
	foreign key must always reference a primary key.
